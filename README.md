Basic steps to do the task:-
1. Collect Data:
Your dataset is prepared with the necessary columns: "Country" and "Population".

2. Load Data:
Use pandas to load the CSV file.

3. Analyze Data:
Use pandas functions like describe() to get summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

4. Visualize Data:
Use seaborn and matplotlib to create a histogram with a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) overlay to show the distribution of population data.
